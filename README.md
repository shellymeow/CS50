Quick Setup: Working Environment
To quickly set up a local working environment containing style50, check50, and submit50 simply open a terminal in your working directory and run pipenv install check50 submit50 style50. This will create a virtual environment that you can access using: pipenv shell. From there you can issue all necessary *50 commands. If you don't have pipenv installed, simply run pip3 install pipenv.


### Important Note: Academic Honesty Policy
Please do not try to submit my answers as your own.

Note that CS50â€™s staff audits submissions to CS50P. Students found to be in violation of the [Academic Honesty policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/honesty/) will be removed from the course and deemed ineligible for a certificate.
